# calculator-in-C

it's a calculator as an exercise of introduction to the C language.
When you open it, it'll require you to use 2 values, 

For example: 
The first value: 20
The second: 2

this will automatically give you the addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of these values,
then will show you:
addition: 22
subtraction: 18
division: 10
multiplication: 40

I hope in the future, as i learn more about the C language get this work better and better.
